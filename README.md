Hi everyone! We are thrilled to be here today to present our exciting project. We are the members of E6, and we've worked together to bring you a unique and engaging experience with our "Guess a Number" website.Now, let me tell you a bit about the game. The "Guess a Number" website challenges users to guess a number between 1 and 100. 
With just 10 chances, players can experience the thrill of guessing, the joy of getting it right, and the suspense as they approach their last attempts.

Now, let's get into the development details. Our "Guess a Number" game was crafted using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provided the structure, CSS added the styling to make it visually appealing, and JavaScript brought interactivity to the game, enabling the logic and user interactions.
It was a fantastic experience blending these technologies to create something enjoyable for all of you.
