      <p class="development-heading">Development Details:</p>
      <p>We used HTML to create the structure of the game, CSS to style it visually, and JavaScript to add interactivity and game logic. Here's a breakdown of how we used each technology:</p>
      
        <p>HTML: For defining the main elements of the game, such as the headings, paragraphs, buttons, and game interface.
           CSS: For styling the game's appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
        JavaScript: For handling user interactions, generating random numbers, checking guesses, providing feedback, and managing the overall game flow.</p>
